// TODO: stub out an auth controller to handle authentication and authorization through the user's choice of sso provider
// TODO: discord should be the default sso provider
// FUTURE: we will add worldanvil sso as well
// FUTURE: eventually, we will add openai sso and allow the user to specify their own openai key to avoid using crit-coins
// TODO: when authenticating through sso, 2FA should be required if it is available for the sso type
// FUTURE: when sso is not available, send a verification code to the user's email address
