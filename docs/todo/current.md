### TODO
- Get Fumblebot running within this repo
- migrate bot logic into website api to reduce load on Fly.io instances and centralize data into website database
- create a new migration with the necessary bot tables; make sure not to duplicate data into new tables if we have existing tables which will work with modifications to the bot
